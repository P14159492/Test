      "The Normans began the construction of the original St Martin’s church of around 900 years ago.",
      "Just over 100 years ago the Victorian Architect, Raphael Brandon, magnificently restored and, in places, rebuilt the church, including the addition of a 220ft spire.",
      "When the Diocese of Leicester was re-established in 1927, the church was hallowed as Leicester Cathedral.",
      "In 680AD, the Saxons gave Leicester its first Bishop, Cuthwine.",
      "For over 1000 years following the departure of its last Saxon Bishop, Leicester had no Bishop and the people of Leicestershire were looked after by the Bishops of Lincoln and later by the Bishops of Peterborough.",	
      "It was not until 1927 that Leicester again had its own Bishop and the Church of St Martin became Leicester Cathedral."

      "Richard was born on 2 October 1452 at Fotheringhay Castle in Northamptonshire. His father was Richard Plantagenet, Duke of York and his mother Cecily Neville.",
      "In August 1485, Henry Tudor, Earl of Richmond, who was a Lancastrian claimant to the throne living in France, landed in South Wales. He marched east and engaged Richard in battle on Bosworth Field in Leicestershire on 22 August.",
      "Although Richard possessed superior numbers, several of his key lieutenants defected. Refusing to flee, Richard was killed in battle and Henry Tudor took the throne as Henry VII.",
      "Richard’s body was brought back to Leicester, publicly displayed and then given for burial to a group of Franciscan friars.",
      "In September 2012, a team of archaeologists from Leicester University uncovered a body believed by some to be the remains of Richard III.",
      "The skeleton was uncovered at the former site of the Grey Friars church in Leicester, where Richard III was reportedly buried.",
      "The church had been destroyed in the 1530s, and the site had been a car parking lot in recent times.",
      "DNA samples were taken from the remains to be compared against a known descendant of Richard III's sister. In February 2013, the DNA results were revealed and verified the archaeological team's suspicions: The remains did, in fact, belong to Richard III.",
      "Shortly after the news broke, plans began for the body of the last Plantagent king to be re-interred. In March 2015, after a funeral that included a solemn ceremony filled with royal pageantry, Richard III was ultimately laid to rest at Leicester Cathedral, not far from the archaeologist's site and where he met his grisly end."

      "The 'Haymarket Memorial Clock Tower' was designed by Joseph Goddard and built in 1868.",

      "Now commonly known as the Clock Tower, it is one of the most recognisable of Leicester’s landmarks. It has become the first traffic island in the country.",
      "The style is Gothic and it was mostly built from Ketton limestone with a base of Mountsorrel granite. The carving of the stone decorations on the Midland Bank in Granby Street, made the four Portland Stone figures.",
      "The clock was supplied by Gillet and Bland of Croydon.",
      "The Clock Tower area has been a focal point for Leicester people throughout its history: this was one of the three places in the town where proclamations were read out by the town crier on important occasions; a few of the older residents can remember V.E. celebrations being held around the Clock Tower and nowadays it is a focal point for our Christmas festivities each year with its magnificent Christmas tree helping to get us into the Christmas spirit."
