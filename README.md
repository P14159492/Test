#Front End Web Development 

##Introduction
This website is about a few key landmarks located in Leicester. It is available online, mainly targeted towards any individuals who are interested in the landmarks in Leicester. 

##Motivation
The idea for developing a website about the history of Leicester, is that I am from Leicester. 

##Designs
1. Wireframe screen designs have been developed for the website, for the end user. 

2. The website has a total of 5 pages. It was originally a Single Page Application (SPA), but it was more user friendly to have multiple pages for the website. 

3. The Navigation Bar is positioned at the top of every page. If also stays fixed at the top of the page, even if the user has scrolled down the page. The navigation bar also provides buttons/ links to the other pages of the website. 

4. Some images include an animation or transition. This allows the website to be interactive for the user. This can be seen when hovering over the image. Another feature included is when the user is hovering over the text, a caption is shown. This was acheived by the use of Cascading Style Sheet (CSS). 

##Testing Application
1. The navigation bar should be functional, so users can access all the pages, from what page they are currently on.  

2. Animations/ Transitions should be working correctly, especially when a user is hovering over an image. 

3. The website should be responsive, for all devices.

##Results
##PARC Design
Proximity, Alignment, Repetition and Contrast (PARC) should be considered when designing a website, as these are the four fundamentals. 

Proximity: Simillar content should be grouped together; done by using simillar styles. 
Alignment: Content on the page should be layout out, which should be easy to read and see for the user. The page/ website is seen as whole. 
Repetition: This provides consistency throughout the whole website.
Contrast: Even though the website should blend together, there should be some distinction between some images and some text.
