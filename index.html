		<h2>History of Leicester</h2>
	<p>Some facts about Leicester include:
	<ul 
	style="list-style-type:square">
	<li>Modern day Leicester has a population of approximately 330,000. The city and county as a whole, have a population of about one million.</li>
	<li>The city was founded by the Romans and was a staging post on the old Fosse Way to Lincoln. Evidence of their occupation can be seen at the Jewry Wall Museum in the city. </li>
	<li>In 1841 Thomas Cook, founder of the famous travel agency, invented tourism when he chartered a train to carry people from Leicester to Loughborough</li>
	<li>The exact centre of England is in Leicestershire marked with a sign on a farm just outside Fenney Drayton.</li>
	<li>Leicester is the birthplace of Walkers crisps as advertised by local hero Gary Lineker!</li>
	<li>The first local radio station was BBC Radio Leicester which began to broadcast in 1967. The radio show 'Down to Earth' has run every month since then and is the longest running, uninterrupted local radio show.</li>
	<li>Leicester has enjoyed 2,000 years of history. The city was founded by the Romans and was a staging post on the old Fosse Way to Lincoln. Evidence of their occupation can be seen at the Jewry Wall Museum in the city.</li>
	<li>The city has two universities: the University of Leicester, just south of the centre, and De Montfort University to the west. The University of Leicester has a highly-rated medical school, but is probably best known for the development of DNA finger-printing and the discovery of King Richard III's remains. The University is also involved in space research and development, and this expertise led to the opening of the National Space Centre in the city, still the only UK visitor attraction dedicated to space.</li>
	<li>De Montfort University is renowned for its Business & Law department, performing arts, fashion and creative industries focus. Indeed, Dave’s Leicester Comedy Festival – the longest running-comedy festival in Europe – originated at De Montfort University.</li>
